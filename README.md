**Introduction**

 This collaborative project explores the blockchain concept through three key classes: `Block`, which represents a single transaction with a block number, previous block Hash, and own cryptographic hash to ensure data integrity; `BlockChain`, which manages the sequence of blocks, facilitate validation, and tracks transactions; and `BlockChainUI`, a command-line interface for user interaction. The `BlockChainUI` allows users to add transactions, create new blocks, view the blockchain, and verify its integrity, providing a simple way to understand core operations. To use the interface, run the program, and follow the prompts, and give commands to interact with the blockchain.
